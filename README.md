# Baking App

[Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801), Project 3.

Allows a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

### Project Overview

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### Why this Project?

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.


### In this project you will:

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

### Task List:

#### General App Usage

#### Components and Libraries
